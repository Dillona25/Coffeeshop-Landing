## Plan on improving the project

This project has many different features to it (listed above). The first page has a working nav bar that will direct you to the corresponding section of the landing page. In the future I would like to add code to these nav bars that will make them pop a little more when a user hovers over them. We then have the landing page title and description which used many different style features as well as flex properties. This goes with the image as well! I do think different fonts could make the landing page flow better. Secondly we have the recipes page. This page contains to API embedded videos that cover recipes we think you will like if your a vistor of this page. Id like to implemtent more of a shadow to each video element to make it look neater. The 3rd pagte of this project is an interactive reservation form! I am super happy with how this form turned out and I wouldnt make much changes to it. It flows very nicely with the landing page. If I did want to improve one aspect of it, that would be having the typed data from the user be a black font and not the same color as the placeholder. When the site is loaded on specific monitors (https://dillona25.github.io/se_project_coffeeshop/) it doesnt look great. The Site was made at 1440, nonetheless I would love to make it a responsive site, but havent quite learned that yet. When I do, I plan on coming back to it and making those chnages with media querys and turning it into a fully responsive site!
