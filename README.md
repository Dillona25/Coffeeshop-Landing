# Coffee Shop

In my quest to master HTML and CSS as I embark into the world of software development I have created a landing page for a fictional coffeeshop. The page features and Hero section, a recepies section with videos, a menu, and a form that allows users to reserve a table. It also features a contact section which features an apealing little animation.

I have many ways Id like to improve this project especially now as I have become proficient in JavaScript and React. I firstly want to make the website fully responsive. As of right now it is only visually appealing at 1280px. I also want to add a modal that opens when the user wants to contact the shop directly. After this, there isnt much more I can do with a fictional coffeeshop besides adding a backend in the future that allows users to log in to an account of their own, and a server that collects data from the form!
