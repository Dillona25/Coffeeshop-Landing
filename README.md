# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

This project has many different features to it (listed above). The first page has a working nav bar that will direct you to the corresponding section of the landing page. In the future I would like to add code to these nav bars that will make them pop a little more when a user hovers over them. We then have the landing page title and description which used many different style features as well as flex properties. This goes with the image as well! I do think different fonts could make the landing page flow better. Secondly we have the recipes page. This page contains to API embedded videos that cover recipes we think you will like if your a vistor of this page. Id like to implemtent more of a shadow to each video element to make it look neater.
